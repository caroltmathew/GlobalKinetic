Hi,


Web services are not exactly an area of strength for me, but I have tried to code RESTful services
for the  most common HTTP transactions for a few endpoints.


[GET : /api/employees]
response body :
{
"employees" : [
{
"id": "id",
"name": "name"
}
]
}



[PUT : /api/employees/{id}]
request body :
{
"id" : "id",
"name" :"name"
}



[DELETE: /api/employees/{id}]
request body :
{
"id" : "id"
}







have additionally put an authentication filter to restrict the access
to 2 of the methods getAllEmployees() and deleteEmployeeById().  
I am sure, the filter could be modified to add the security token functionality.



the following have been used in this project:


Java SDK 8
Apache Tomcat 8.5.16
JAX-RS (Jersey 2.25.1)
Eclipse Oxygen
POSTMAN chrome extension


Deployment and Testing:

The WAR file needs to be deployed on the server.
Though there is a file with the client code, i only used POSTMAN to test the methods.


GET All

http://localhost:8080/GlobalKinetic/rest/employees



GET by ID

http://localhost:8080/GlobalKinetic/rest/employees/1



POST

http://localhost:8080/GlobalKinetic/rest/employees

(New employee details as application/XML in the body of the message)



PUT

http://localhost:8080/GlobalKinetic/rest/employees/{id}

(Employee details to be updated as application/XML in the body of the message)



DELETE

http://localhost:8080/GlobalKinetic/rest/employees/{id}
